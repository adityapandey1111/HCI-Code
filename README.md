# Human-Computer-Interaction-using-Gestures

## INTRODUCTION
● Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) refers to the study and design of computer technology, interfaces, and systems that are intended to be used by humans.

● HCI is important because it helps to create systems that are more user-friendly, intuitive, and effective in meeting the needs of their users.

● Our project explores the use of gestures as a natural and intuitive way of interacting with computers, as gestures are a powerful means of communication and expression that have been used by humans for centuries.

● By incorporating gestures into Human Computer Interaction, we aim to create a more efficient, enjoyable, and accessible computing experience for everyone.

● Here is some benefits because of which gesture is efficient over traditional use :

    ● Diversification of input methods
    
    ● Improved user experience
    
    ● Increased efficiency and productivity
